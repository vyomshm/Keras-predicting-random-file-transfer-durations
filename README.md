# Keras-predicting-random-file-transfer-durations
Jupyter notebooks to create random file transfer data on an ElasticSearch Cluster in order to train a neural network to predict the file transfer duration.

## Note:

MY cluster, hosted on an older version of the ElasticSearch (v-1.7). To make sure this code runs you will need to downgrade your elasticsearch-py version in your environment. You can install the correct version by running :

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

after you've cloned this repository.
